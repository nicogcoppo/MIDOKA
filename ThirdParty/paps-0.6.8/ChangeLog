	* configure.in: Bumped version to 0.6.7

	* src/paps.1: Described the new options.

	* src/paps.c: 
	
	(split_text_into_paragraphs) Reverted to old
	split_text_into_paragraphs as I couldn't understand Akira's code
	and I don't think it is relevant anymore with the new cpi/lpi
	interpretation.
	
        (split_text_into_paragraphs) Added functionality for using markup.

        - Added option --markup for printing pango markup'd text.
	
	- Changed the interpretation of LPI so that it only controls the
	line spacing and not the size of the characters.
	
	- Added option --stretch-chars to stretch characters to fill
	the --lpi value.
	
	- Removed global variables lpi and cpi and moved them into
	page_layout_t .

	- Changed creation of options to allow passing the
	page_layout_t as a parameter.  

	- Removed all references to wchar as it is not used anymore. (It
	shouldn't have been used in the first place as there are plenty of
	utf8 and ucs4 manipulating function in glib.)
		
	* src/libpaps.c:
	Moved the stretching of characters to c-level only. Erased the
	scale_x and scale_y parameters from most functions.
